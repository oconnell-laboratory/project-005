The “whole_blood_DESeq2_script.r”, “whole_blood_edgeR_script.r”, and “whole_blood_limma_script.r” files contain the respective R scripts used to perfrom zero-order comparison of gene expression between whole blood samples originating from donors with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios in the upper (Hi) and lower (Low) quartiles using each of DESeq2, edgeR, and limma-voom. The “whole_blood_raw_counts.csv” file contains an expression matrix containing the filtered raw RNAseq counts generated from said samples. The “whole_blood_meta_data.csv” file contains the associated metadata, including the sample ID, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio category of the donor, and the total sequencing library size (calculated from mapped reads prior to filtering).

The “isolated_wbc_DESeq2_script.r” file contains the R script used to compare gene expression between isolated human neutrophils and isolated human lymphocytes originally profiled by Uhlen et. al. as part of the Human Protein Atlas project. The “isolated_wbc_tpm_values.csv” file contains an expression matrix containing the filtered TPM values for each leukocyte sample. The “whole_blood_meta_data.csv” file contains the associated metadata including the sample ID and cell type.
